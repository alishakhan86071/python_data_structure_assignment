        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans. Object oriented programming is a way of writing code that is mainly based on objects. Its features include abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "ans. A class in OOP is like template that we used to defien something\n",
        "for ex: we created a class named \"student\" and it has each student have data like name, roll_no etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans. n object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a real-world instance created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans. abstration is the feature which show only the important details and hides the internal logic while encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data and method together.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans. Any method with double underscore is known as dunder method.\n",
        "ex: __init__()\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "ans. inheritance is the process of deriving the features of parent class to the main class. there are various types of inheritance like single inheritance, multiple inheritance etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "ans. The word polymorphism stands for one in many form. It means that one function can have different behaviour based on the object\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "ans.Encapsulation is python is achieved by restricting access to internal variables and methods while allowing controlled interaction with public methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "ans.A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects of a class when they're created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. class method can modify class-level data and be used as an alternative constructor.\n",
        "static method  are used for general-purpose logic related to the class but not tied to its data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "ans. Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "12. what is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "ans. method overriding helps when a child provide its own version of the method which is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Ans. The property decorator lets us access methods like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism is important in OOP because we can create a multiple object and using polymorphism we don't have to write the same code again and again for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Ans An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes — it defines methods that must be implemented by child classes but does not provide full behavior itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Ans. Advantages of OOP include:\n",
        "-Modularity\n",
        "-Reusability\n",
        "-Abstraction\n",
        "-Inheritance\n",
        "-Encapsulation\n",
        "-Polymorphism,etc\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Ans class variable is shared accross all instances of the class and it is defined outside any function, while instance variable is unique to each object of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "ans. when a child class inherits the features of multiple parent class, then it is known as multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "ans. __str__ returns a readable and clean string\n",
        "__repr__ returns a precise string.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "ans.The super() function in Python is used to give child classes access to methods from their parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans.  The __del__ method in Python is a destructor .It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Ans. static method does not take anything as there argument while classmethod take cls as their first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "ans.  In Python, polymorphism with inheritance lets child classes customize or override methods from their parent class .\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "ans. Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called one after the other on the same object — all in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans. __call__ is a special method in Python that lets an instance of a class be used like a function — as if you could “call” the object directly.\n",
